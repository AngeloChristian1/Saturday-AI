<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
About The Project
This project focuses on leveraging the natural resistance of cassava to drought by studying its DNA and identifying specific sequences called enhancers that play a role in gene regulation. Participants will use a dataset containing 10,000-base pair DNA sequences from the cassava genome, along with associated information such as the chromosome and a target label indicating whether a specific region overlaps with an enhancer. The goal is to build predictive models for enhancer regulatory activity in the cassava genome. The project relies on a combination of genomics, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques, making use of pre-trained NLP models specifically designed to analyze DNA sequences.
